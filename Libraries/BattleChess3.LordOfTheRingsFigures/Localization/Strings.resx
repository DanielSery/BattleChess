Aragorn
            
Aragorn II, the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the 16th Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North; later crowned King Elessar Telcontar (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the 26th King of Arnor, and the 35th King of Gondor and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, in the War of the Ring.
            
Sauron

Sauron (or Þauron (Thauron); Quenya; IPA: [ˈsaʊron] or Vanyarin; IPA: [ˈθaʊron] - \"The Abhorred\"), the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was a fallen Maia, the creator of the One Ring, and the most trusted lieutenant of his master Melkor (Morgoth, the first Dark Lord). After Melkor's defeat in the First Age, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and strove to conquer Arda by creating the Rings of Power. In the Second Age, he was defeated in the War of the Last Alliance by the last line of defense: Elves and Men under kings Gil-galad and Elendil.

Frodo
         
Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during the Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third Age.
            
Gollum

Gollum, originally known as Sméagol (or Trahald), was at first a Stoor, one of the three early Hobbit-types. The name Gollum was derived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. His birth can be estimated to have happened in the year TA 2430. His death date is given as March 25, 3019. His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring. At the time of his death, Sméagol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit, but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.

Gandalf
   
Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - \"Elf of the Wand\" or \"Wand-elf\") the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - \"Dreamer\" or \"Of Dreams\"), was an Istar (wizard), sent by the West in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
            
The Witch-king

The Witch-king of Angmar was the leader of the Nazgûl or Ringwraiths, and Sauron's second-in-command during the Second and Third Ages. Once a Númenórean king of men, he was corrupted by one of the nine Rings of Power that had been given to the lords of men, and became an undead wraith in the service of Sauron. After the first defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance, the Witch-king fled to Angmar, a kingdom he ruled for over thousands of years until he returned to Mordor to lead Sauron's armies in the War of the Ring. He stabbed Frodo Baggins on Weathertop during the first months of Frodo's venture out of the Shire to Rivendell.

After the defeat of Sauron, he was given lordship of the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep.
            
The Nazgûl

The Nazgûl (also known as Ringwraiths, The Nine, The Fallen Kings, Black Riders, Nunbolg, or Ulairi in Quenya) were the dreaded ring-servants of the Dark Lord Sauron in Middle-earth throughout the Second and Third ages, and in the later years of the Third Age, they dwelt in Minas Morgul and Dol Guldur.

Legolas

Legolas was a Sindarin elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. As he was the son of the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was Prince of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), a messenger, and a master bowman. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other members of the Fellowship. He was well-known for becoming friends with the dwarf Gimli, despite their long-held differences. It is not known whether Legolas was Thranduil's only son, or whether he was his heir. His age is unknown as well.

Samwise Gamgee, also known as Sam, was a Hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo Baggins' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be Frodo's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship of the Ring, and also played a necessary role in protecting Frodo and destroying the One Ring.            

Saruman
            
Saruman (Quenya; IPA: ['saruman] - \"Man Of Skill\"), also known as Saruman the White was an Istar (wizard), who lived in Middle-earth during the Third Age. Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself. Thinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated. He studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to oppose him, but he soon became enamored of Sauron's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his mission and sought the power of the Ring for himself. He initially advocated an alliance with Sauron, but he soon betrayed Sauron as well, as his ultimate goal was to supplant Sauron and rule Middle-earth. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.

The Guards of the Citadel
   
The Guards of the Citadel, sometimes referred to as the Guards of the Tower of Gondor, were the warriors responsible for guarding the upmost level of Minas Tirith, especially the courtyard that held the fountain and the White Tree of Gondor, and gave way the thronehall. They served as personal bodyguards to the Kings of Gondor, and later to the Stewards of Gondor until King Aragorn II Elessar's coronation. They were mainly a stationary guard unit, rather than a mobile force, though were sometimes seen acting as a mobile guard when travelling with the Steward.They were headed by a Captain of the Citadel, who was chosen by the Steward from nobility or high military ranks. As a whole, they were considered to be the best soldiers in the realm of Gondor. Known for their bravery, fighting skills, and unshakable loyalty, they swear an oath against their own lives to serve their lord.            

Orcs
            
Before Oromë found the Elves at Cuiviénen, Melkor enslaved some of them and cruelly tortured them, turning them into Orcs. Many Orcs(along with fallen Maiar and other evil servants of Melkor) survived in the deep caves, pits, chambers, and tunnels of Melkor's great underground fortresses of Utumno and Angband. They multiplied and later spread through northern Middle-earth. They were first seen by the Dwarves who reported them to King Thingol, the High King of the Sindar, causing the latter to seek weapons of war for the first time. For over a millennium, the orcs were only a minor problem, but when Melkor (Morgoth) returned with the Silmarils he took full charge of them and soon unleashed them on Beleriand. The newly organised orcs killed Denethor, the King of the lightly armed Laiquendi, but were eventually defeated by Thingol and his allies. They besieged the Havens of the Falas under Círdan, and the siege wasn't broken until the arrival of the Ñoldor.The heavy losses that the Sindar suffered at the hands of the Orcs frightened them to the point that Melian, Queen of Doriath raised a great enchantment to protect their kingdom.The Laiquendi, who suffered the most in the battle, hid themselves in the Ossiriand under the cloak of secrecy, or took refuge in Doriath.
